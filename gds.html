                                                    <p class="medium">
                                                   I was hired as the second designer on Genospace's product and design team. Previously at Genospace, there wasn't an established design team nor a formal design process until my team lead Beth and I joined within the same month. However, as Genospace aims to really expand the product scale and to reach more users and clients, it is critical that a design process and good design practices be established as we start out expanding. 
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p class="medium">
                                                   It can be hard to create space for systematic design without a firm process set up - especially in a quickly iterating, rapidly growing startup.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p class="medium">
                                                   Therefore, we took on the challenge to establish our core design principles and the design system to provide all our product owners and engineers with a single source of truth for how Genospace platform and applications should look and feel to our users.

                                                    A design system is a collection of user interface (UI) components, patterns, guidelines and processes aimed at creating unified digital user experiences. Design systems provide engineers with pieces of code, which in many cases are bundled into reusable packages that can be added to new or existing applications, preventing engineers from building the same pieces over and over.

                                                    Over the past few years, we’ve seen a rise in companies building design systems, driven by the need for efficiency in design and development workflows, consistency in user experiences and unification of branding. We've all had the experience spending much time specifying all the detail specs, margins, paddings, border radius when delivering a design. A design system has those answers built into the code. </p>
                                                    <p class="medium">
                                                    But a good design system isn’t just a repository of code, it’s a curated collection of code and ideas that backed up by our core design principles. A good design system comes as the result of thoughtful and intentional choices, which take into account consistency across applications and experiences, the representation of our brand, best practices from a design, user experience (UX) and accessibility perspective. It should also include supporting documentation that helps users navigate and understand all of this information.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p class="medium">
                                                    More importantly, while a design system provides guidelines and standards to keep a team aligned, it shouldn’t be a static resource. It should constantly adapts to feedback and evolves as the platform and applications grow.

                                                    We started with Brad Frost’s atomic design. By starting with the most elemental UI components, such as a humble button, one can build a design system that’s lean, organized, and adaptable.
                                                    One shortcoming of atomic design, as several have pointed out, is that it doesn’t differentiate between styles and assets. We opted to build a modified version of atomic design system that would separate certain stylistic components into their own swim lane.

                                                    Once we had all the big decisions in place, we were ready to build the components! We discussed what parts of the current component designs we wanted to take the opportunity to enhance and tackled questions like, “How do we make the most reusable components while still enforcing our brand?” and, “What configurable options for components are we going to allow?” In our early phases, we went with a more configuration-based component architecture where many components would accept arrays of data to inject into the UI. We’ve since started to transition to a more composition-based architecture because we found it allows for more flexibility for developers and gives the components more room to grow.</p>
