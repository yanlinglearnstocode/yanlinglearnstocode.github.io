                                                   As a biomedical data platform, Genospace specializes in clinical trial matching and providing clinical-genomic data aggregation for large-scale drug development analysis. The successful running of the platform and the services rely upon accurate, well-structured data that has been formatted for application needs. Every day, there are more than 30,000 files of different formats from EHR system, molecular profiling vendors, and clients flowing into Genospace's platform. There is a dedicated data engineering team responsible for processing, cleaning and preparing data from all the sources to power the platform's core functions. <br> <br>Ingress Â® by Genospace is an extensive data ingest and preparation application that's used by the data engineering team. While it's integrated with the Genospace core platform, it faces limitations and lacking of certain features as the platform scales. We also see a need from external data users to prep and transform data on their own. How do we reduce the complexity of working with data and accelerate time-to-production for our platform? I led the design process to build a more accessible, intuitive, and stream-lined data management tool.

                                                    The data cleaning and preparation process of extracting data from different file formats, converting sets of data values from a source format to a format consistent for a destination data system has long been considered tedious, complicated, and time-consuming. Yet, it's crucial to the successful running of our application and the services we provide, especially to the analytics platform users.

                                                    Every day, Genospace platform receives more than 30,000 files of various formats from hospitals, EHR companies, and molecular profiling vendors. When it comes to complex or large volumes of data, the work would demand advanced data science skills and knowledge of organizational data. The data engineering team at Genospace works dedicatedly to process, clean, and prepare the data so it's consistent and of high quality. However, there are many tedious and repetitive steps in the process that are not the best use of data engineers' time. Additionally, data engineers also need to ues multiple tools and many workarounds in order to prepare data efficiently. Lastly, as we work with more clients, we want to open up Ingress as a powerful tool for external users, so they can load data and prepare data by themselves. Therefore, it's critical to radically accelerate the process of transforming data and reduce the time it takes to analyze information and get the most out of the data. </p>

The exploration process allows user to gain a good understanding for the unique elements of the data such as value distributions and outliers to inform the data transformation and analysis. User can submit search queries, filter data by any fields, view the source document data, and have visual summary of the data. This is a great point for both initiating and validating a data preparation workflow.</p>

With an extensive study with our data engineer user panel, it became evident that there were some major pain points in current Ingress.

The research showed that in order to open up Ingress as a powerful data managing tool to clients and external users, we need to step up our game in making the data ingest, data transformation and the data validating process easier and more accessible. With a fully-improved application, Genospace data team will be able to work with data of much larger sizes and be able to deliver high-quality data consistently.</p>

                                                    Not only was this project important because it was one of the top requests we continued to hear from our own data team, but it also provided tremendous value to the business. Since at the same time, Genospace has made the effort to turn Ingress into a validated system, which opens up much more opportunities for working with bio-pharmaceutical data. Therefore it's critical that we enhance the capabilities of Ingress so that it can handle the new complexity of the work. </p>

                                                    The opportunity for Genospace was specific: on the one hand we enhance the Ingress functions and capabilities to equip our data engineering team so they can provide stellar data services at a much larger scale; on the other hand by utilizing the Ingress platform and making data preparation much easier, we could potentially open up Ingress to external users and package it as a great data transformation tool along with our analytics products. We visualized the implication of the data management process and how it works as a key component of Genospace ecosystem.

                                                    The design and the concept development of Ingress data management solution is a rather complicated process that involves much detailed workflow mapping and interaction design. It also involves extensive collaboration with the engineering team to work with certain technologies and constraints. I met regularly with the product engineer team and the infrastructure team to get technical feasibility feedbcak about my design, and the feedback helped shape the final design solutions. A few key design decisions I made throughout this process include:</p>

                                                    One of the main pain points I wanted to address was the gaps and broken links in the old data management workflow. Due to lack of proper collaboration workflow and data inspection capabilities. Data engineering users had to work in a test environment to experiment and test data preparation process before finalizing it in production. Therefore, my first design exploration was on how to stitch all different functionalities together and making it easier to initiate a transformation work or to resolve an error.</p>

                                                    Ingress data management platform is such a larger piece to design for and requires a lot of time and effort in back-end planning and implementation. From the design perspective, it is most critical and feasible to use modular design principles and to design components and functionalities that can be applied in multiple places. This helps save a lot of engineering effort, it also helps reinforce a functionality for users and creates a consistent look and feel throughout the entire platform.</p>

It can be used as a landing view for users to discover exactly what data is loaded into the platform and to quickly identify value distributions and outliers that can inform a transformation and analysis workflow. 2. It is also used when user dives into individual file, a bundle of files or different data sets to give user a overview of the data within a particular scope. 3. More importantly in the actual file parser configuration and the data transformation work, "data exploring view" is again used to give users the transparency on how they shape and transform the data.</p>

This project has truly got me dive into the data management domain and I have had so much fun learning and designing for data intensive applications. As of May 2020, most of the features that were part of this vision (data exploring, smart transformation configuration, seamless versioning and collaboration workflow) have been released or are in the pipeline of implementation. This will still be an ongoing process as we started to monitor usage data, metrics and collect user feedback for continuous improvement.</p>
