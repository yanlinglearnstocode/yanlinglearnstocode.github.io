                                        <b>The Client:</b> As a leading online video platform, Brightcove offers its clients a software development kit(SDK) that allows for customization and video storage, downloading and viewing. Brightcove's clients span a variety of industries and reside in countries around the world including Home Depot and Hulu Japan, among many others. Brightcove SDK gives clients a customizable platform to offer video services to their customers, who have the ability to search, download and watch videos online or offline.

The project focused on conducting the usability testing and comparative study of Brightcove offline playback application to its client-identified leading competitor, Netflix. I led efforts in exploring and comparing different user research methodologies, conducting competitive analysis and drafting key findings and recommendations in the final report. I also worked on conducting user interviews, generating observations and writing full reports.

                                    Participants were given an Android phone with the Brightcove application installed. They were directed to finish several tasks including finding, downloading, checking download status and watching a video offline. Participants were also asked to articulate their thoughts and think aloud as they walked through tasks. If they got stuch, minimal assistance was given.

                                    I gathered and ordered user feedback and my observations and findings throughout the testing and used Jeff Sauro's 3 point severity rating scale to identify what Brightcove is doing well and which are areas for improvement based on priority. I also drafted initial recommendations regarding different usability issues. The findings and recommendations were then combined with the separate competitive analysis results to produce a holistic report with key findings and recommendations on Brightcove mobile video application.

                                    Several key aspects that need to be improved upon within the Brightcove app are consistent between both competitive analysis and user testing.

By comparing results from the two studies, we generated recommendations for implementation and future analysis.

                                    Our project was limited by time and resources, though not to the point of being ineffective. The client was able to offer incentive for recruitment, so we were able to test our target number of participants. We worked on the competitive analysis simultaneously, so we were able to allocate sufficient time to both methodologies.

                                    A next step that the client might take would be to run these same tests with a fully built-out SDK. Many of the participant observations were a direct result of the perceived “outdatedness” of the SDK, which may be mitigated if it were to be used by one of Brightcove’s clients. Additionally, Brightcove might examine its technical capabilities and see how the download speed could be improved and error messages better avoided.
