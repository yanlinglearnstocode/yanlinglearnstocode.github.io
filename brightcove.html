					<h2 style="color:#343434;">My Role</h2>
					<p>I teamed up with three classmates working on a project for the client Brightcove - a leading online video platform starting October 2017. The project focused on conducting the usability testing and comparative study of Brightcove offline playback application to its client-identified leading competitor, Netflix. I led efforts in exploring and comparing different user research methodologies, conducting competitive analysis and drafting key findings and recommendations in the final report. I also worked on conducting user interviews, generating observations and writing full reports.</p>

					<h2 style="color:#343434;">Client Overview</h2>
					<p>As a leading online video platform, Brightcove offers its clients a software development kit(SDK) that allows for customization and video storage, downloading and viewing. Brightcove's clients span a variety of industries and reside in countries around the world including Home Depot and Hulu Japan, among many others. Brightcove SDK gives clients a customizable platform to offer video services to their customers, who have the ability to search, download and watch videos online or offline.</p>

                    <h2 style="color:#343434;">Main Methodologies</h2>
                    <p>We conducted two forms of research simultaneously. After obtaining IRB approval, we performed an <strong>in-person guerilla study</strong> with a total of 12 participants. Separately, we also completed a comprehensive <strong>competitive study</strong> between Brightcove and Netflix. The competitive study focused exclusively on Netflix's mobile interfaces and video experience.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <h2 style="color:#343434;">Guerilla Testing and User Interviews</h2>
                    <p>We were offered the choice of using UserTesting.com or conducting in-person guerilla testing. Given that a portion of our study would include a competitive study against Netflix, and given the small number of participants we were expected to interview (10-12), we felt that guerilla testing would yield more insightful, actionable results.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:#343434;">Target User Population</h4>
                    <p>We discussed participant criteria with our client, and determined that anyone who has prior experience with mobile video watching would qualify. In actual testing, our target user population were <i>Bentley University students, age 19-26, who have experience watching videos on a mobile device.</i></p>

                    <h4 style="color:#343434;">Location and Equipment</h4>
                    <p>Recruiting and study were conducted in Bentley's Student Center. Some incentives were offered for participation. A Mac laptop was used to record audio only, and those recordings were made available exclusively to the research team.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:#343434;">Preliminary Questions To Ask</h4>

                    <p>In actual testing, we recruited 12 participants for our application. We started with the background questions we designed to understand their prior experience, observed and recorded participants as they performed tasks, and followed up with brief wrap-up questions. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). We generated a preliminary overview as following about our participants after asking background questions.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:#343434;">Scenario and Tasks</h4>
                    <p>Participants were given an Android phone with the Brightcove application installed. They were directed to finish several tasks including <i>finding, downloading, checking download status and watching a video offline</i>. Participants were also asked to articulate their thoughts and think aloud as they walked through tasks. If they got stuck, minimal assistance was given.</p>

                    <h4 style="color:#343434;">Evaluate User Feedback and Findings with Jeff Sauro's 3 point Severity Scale</h4>
                    <p>I gathered and ordered user feedback and my observations and findings throughout the testing and used Jeff Sauro's 3 point severity rating scale to identify what Brightcove is doing well and which are areas for improvement based on priority. I also drafted initial recommendations regarding different usability issues. The findings and recommendations were then combined with the separate competitive analysis results to produce a holistic report with key findings and recommendations on Brightcove mobile video application.</p>

                    <p>In addition to the guerilla testing, we completed a comprehensive comparison with similar aspects of Netflix's application interfaces and Brightcove's download and offline video functions. Comparisons are drawn from the following aspects of Brightcove's interface:</p>
                    <li>View video listings;</li>
                    <li>Select a video (buy/rent);</li>
                    <li>Check videos ready to be downloaded;</li>
                    <li>Download a video and track downloading progress;</li>
                    <li>Watch a downloaded video offline.</li>

                    <p>Brightcove has several actionable recommendations that could drastically improve interactions for users.</p>
                    <p>Most of the recommendations are simple, and some are purely aesthetic; these should be straightforward and relatively cost-effective to implement.</p>
                    <p>Most users want to watch videos online, so Brightcove needs to adequately incentivize users to take that next step.</p>
                    <p>Visual affordances need to be added throughout to guide users through searching for, finding, downloading, and viewing appropriate videos.</p>

                    <h2 style="color:#343434;">Connection between Competitive Analysis and Testing Results</h2>
                    <p>Competitive Analysis and User Testing on the Brightcove video app were conducted independently. Results generated from the two tasks are designed to complement and confirm one another in order to provide a holistic evaluation.</p>
                    <p>Several key aspects that need to be improved upon within the Brightcove app are consistent between both competitive analysis and user testing. These include: efficiently downloading a video, checking and understanding download progress, and successfully watching downloaded videos offline.</p>
                    <p>While user testing generated findings by observing users interacting with Brightcove app and interviewing users directly, competitive analysis generated findings by comparing the Brightcove app against Netflix, the primary client-identified competitor. By comparing results from the two studies, we generated recommendations for implementation and future analysis.</p>

                    <p>We attempted to implement traditional Scrum practices into our process. The most successful of these practices were standup meetings, user story tasks, and diverging/converging to brainstorm ideas.</p>

                    <h2 style="color:#343434;">Discussion</h2>
                    <p>Our hope is that the implications of this project are that Brightcove has actionable insight on the changes they could make to improve their mobile application SDK, in addition to insights about what the application is doing well right now.</p>

                     <h2 style="color:#343434;">Limitations</h2>
                    <p>Our project was limited by time and resources, though not to the point of being ineffective. The client was able to offer incentive for recruitment, so we were able to test our target number of participants. We worked on the competitive analysis simultaneously, so we were able to allocate sufficient time to both methodologies.</p>

                     <h2 style="color:#343434;">Future Approaches/Next Steps</h2>
                    <p>A next step that the client might take would be to run these same tests with a fully built-out SDK. Many of the participant observations were a direct result of the perceived “outdatedness” of the SDK, which may be mitigated if it were to be used by one of Brightcove’s clients. Additionally, Brightcove might examine its technical capabilities and see how the download speed could be improved and error messages better avoided.</p>
