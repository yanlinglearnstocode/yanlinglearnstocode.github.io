The project focused on conducting the usability testing and comparative study of Brightcove offline playback application to its client-identified leading competitor, Netflix. I led efforts in exploring and comparing different user research methodologies, conducting competitive analysis and drafting key findings and recommendations in the final report. I also worked on conducting user interviews, generating observations and writing full reports.</p>

                                        <p>Brightcove has several actionable recommendations that could drastically improve interactions for users.</p>

Many of the participant observations were a direct result of the perceived “outdatedness” of the SDK, which may be mitigated if it were to be used by one of Brightcove’s clients. Additionally, Brightcove might examine its technical capabilities and see how the download speed could be improved and error messages better avoided.</p>
