                                                        Clinical trials are the primary ways medical researchers investigate if a new treatment (a drug or a therapy) - is safe and effective for people to use. While a single trial can be costly, patient recruitment takes up over 25% of the funds allocated to research trials. Genospace specializes in speeding up clinical trial research. With the extensive knowledgebase and advanced algorithms, we are able to match fragmented patient data to complex trial criteria and expedite patient recruitment. In order to successfully match patients to trials so that they can get the best-fit treatment, one critical component is the accurate capture of trial enrolling criteria, patient attributes and disease associations for a therapy drug. <br><br>Clarify Â® by Genospace is an extensive application for precise medical information capture, but it started to face limitations as our trial database scaled. How could we improve the curation efficiency to speed up patient recruitment? I led the redesign process to improve Clarify usability and to extend its feature set.

                                                    The lifecycle of a clinical trial matching mechanism starts with importing trial protocols into the system based on established medical oncologies. Genospace and Sarah Cannon curation teams use Clarify to establish and manage a central knowledgebase of trials and precision medical information. More specifically, the curation team is responsible to convert the protocol language (including amendments) into machine-readable inclusion/exclusion criteria with different weights. The standardized information will then be processed by the backend system and be used to match patients to the most suitable trials. As more trial protocols get entered into Genospace, along with constant amendments being added to protocols, curation team face challenges curating trials, and monitoring and validating changes quickly.

                                                    There are also limitations with the rather outdated interface which slow the curation efficiency. For example, the old Clarify layout doesn't enable recognition of output effectively. The rule creation process was also rather tedious, requiring many clicks, therefore slowing down curating efficiency. Certain functions (eg. version control) are missing, which make QA process more time-consuming.</p>
                                                    <p class="medium"> At the same year, one of Genospace's business goals is to improve trial match specificity by 20%, which naturally requires more accurate trial curation. It was the perfect timing to start the Clarify Improvement initiative. (add some pics to demonstrate the current state)

                                                    While curation scientists are the main power users of Clarify, clinical research program managers can also benefit from Clarify to finish trial feasibility assessment. However, there are some major pain points that block curation scientists from curating more efficiently, and a lack of certain feature for program managers to really adopt the tool:

It would be a big engineering lift to implement all features at the same time along with other company initiatives. Therefore, we broke down the features by feasibility, desirability, and viability. We also evaluated individual feature by the effort/impact scale to decide on which feature to develop first that can yield largest impact for users. (add a pic of feasibility evaluation)</p>

                                                    The Clarify redesign process is a rather complicated process that involves much detailed workflow mapping and interaction design. Throughout the concept development process, I benefited much from constantly reviewing the design with my user panel - the curation team and prototyping with real data and concrete examples.<br> It helps me take the complexity into consideration from the very beginning. Among all the different aspects of the design iteration, below are some examples of how my designs evolved along the way:</p>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <h4 class="block-size-4">
                                                    The Layout
                                                    </h4>
                                                    <p class="medium">
                                                    The original layout of the Clarify curating interface was a 50/50 form where user can scroll the left side content and fill out the form on the right. While it's useful to have the curation and the editor side by side, the original layout wasted a lot of space and requires a lot of scrolling.<br>My initial exploration around better curation UI was rather conservative. I wanted to create a design that needs minimal engineering effort. But as I spoke with users and the engineering team, it turned out that the layout change wouldn't be a huge lift. Users can also benefit a lot from having more space when editing trial criteria and rules. I then started to pursue a full-width layout and explore how to best navigate around it. </p>

                                                    </h4>
                                                    <p class="medium">
                                                    The rule builder is one of the most chanllenging part in developing the new UI for Clarify because the rule builder is essentially a combiination of a form and a query builder that translates plain langugae into system-recognizable data. On the one hand, user needs to be able to quickly transform text into structured data, on the other hand, user also needs the flexibility to construct complex logic that feeds into the matching algorithm.</p>
                                                    <p class="medium">
                                                    More specifically, user needs to be able to map data onto different established medical categories. User also needs to create different condition groups using the rule builder. The original rule builder was quite comprehensive, but it lacked visual clarity and can be extremely hard to read when a rule gets very complicated. I spent a lot of time exploring different styles and components to construct a powerful yet elegant rule builder. I also gained user feedback not only from curation team but also general users to make sure the interaction is truly easy to use.</p>
                                                    <p class="medium">
                                                    As a bonus result of the exploration, the rule builder concept was adopted by other team members in other products.</p>

                                                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                                                <p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:300; line-height: 32px;">This was a really exciting and fun initiative for me to work on as it was one of my first full-scope product initative, it provides real business and user value, involved a lot of research, and detailed design work. As mentioned above, the whole Clarify improvement was broken up into several relase candidates, and the curation versioning workflow and the UI improvement have been implemented and launched as new features. Throughout the process, I learned a tremendous amount related to product design and development with users.</p>
                                                <h6>How to design in a new domain</h6>
                                                <p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:300; line-height: 32px;">This will always be a challenge when designing for enterprise products and professional users. I benefited significantly from having a user panel right at the beginning of the project. It's also important to establish a good relationship with my user panel to constantly listen to them and absorb feedback. It's also the best way to familiarize myself of a new domain.</p>
                                                <h6>How to prioritize and utiliize a large solution concept</h6>
                                                <p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:300; line-height: 32px;">While it's always preferrable to come up with the full-scope, end-to-end solution based on the user journey. It is important to understand how to break down large concept into chunks and prioritize features when coming to actual implementation. I learned a lot by working with the product owner and the engineering lead to understand how best evaluate a new feature and the implementation effort.</p>
                                                <h6>Always fight for good UX</h6>
                                                <p style="font-size:18px; font-weight:300; line-height: 32px;">While I had to work with very strict technical constraints, I still fought for what I believe is essential to having a good user experience.</p>
