Most consumers have limited knowledge on how to get enough and effective protection from using sunscreen. When consumers do wear sunscreen, they often apply too little or fail to reapply when needed.

The team focused on exploring problem space, discovering user needs and creating useful solutions and delightful experience. Up until December 2017, I led efforts in conducting user interviews, defining high-level requirements, making 3-D paper prototypes, creating mobile application wireframes, and refining hi-fi prototypes.

                                    To better understand what are the inconveniences people are facing with sun protection in their daily life, we conducted 12 interviews in total with users of different gender, ages, occupations, outdoor activity frequencies. The interviews seek to explore users' outdoor activities pattern, sun protection habits, and motivations for sun protection. To summarize our initial findings, we generated two composite personas from the interviews: Amanda Peters, a young female who focuses on her own sun protection practices; and Catherine Change, a mother who concerns about her children's sun protection.

Starting off the features, we found several products on the market as competitors. After comparison, we concluded that the necessary functionalities to incorporate sun protection into daily life are distributed in different products. We found out that though smart sun protection product has been a trend in sun care market, current products still have relatively narrow scope and have common problems in usability and user experiences.

                                    To kick off the product design process, we came up with context scenarios for both personas Amanda and Catherine in the form of storyboards. When looking into both context scenarios, we found out that while both personas have common problems and needs for a smart UV detecting and reminding product, there are some big implications in terms of designing the overall product and expereince depending on whether it's targeting a single user or a caretaker and children. After careful consideration, we decided to start from focusing on one persona - the single user Amanda.

                                    To further understand how users can incorporate our solution, we dived deeper in uderstanding our primary persona Amanda who is a young, busy woman in her late 20s and is motivated to use our products to improve her sun protection habits. In addition to the general storyboard created for Amanda, we broke down her use cases into goals, features users want to have, and potential product functions. Furthermore, product functions are mapped to satisfy both functional needs and emotional needs.

                                    After mapping out user goals and needs, we concluded that the most important features should be accurate UV radiation detection, accurate timer, easy-to-interact and non-disturbing reminders, easy-to-understand data and summary and lightweight portable tracker. Therefore, we decided to design a combination of a portable smart gadget and a mobile application as it is the best way to synthesize these features together. I summarized our design framework in the following table.

                                    We decided not to create the wearable in a ring form because the ring would be too small to show useful information. Rings are also hard to be securely fastened to one's bag or clothing. We were also aware of the fact that many people already have wristbands like fitbits or smart watches, therefore, we decided to make the wearable to be easily used in different forms, it can be worn as a wristband and the main information component can be detached and be used as a clip that can be easily and securely attached to clothing or bags when going out. We came up with an initial design of the wearable component and made a rough physical prototype.

We sketched the push notifications to users when they choose to receive notifications through cell phone. We also sketched the interface of the wearable monitor. The basic principle of designing these interfaces is to be simple and straightforward, the mobile app and the wearable should require as less interaction from users as possible and provide useful reminders and important metrics at the same time.

                                    Moving forward, we will do further testings with users in terms of interactions with Sun Smart wearable and the mobile app. We also want to further develop the 3-D prototype for the wearable and explore differnt possibilities in material, form, power sources, etc.

                                    While we think promoting better sun protection habits could be one of the important aspects for a UV monitor. Sun Smart could be further refined and be applied with extended functionalities. We envision Sun Smart could help people get enough sunshine and vitamin D while taking appropriate sun protection methods. We would also want to explore how Sun Smart can be used by children and let parents monitor and apply sun protection measures. Furthermore, Sun Smart can also potentially be used as powerful gardening tool that helps garden owners keep track of different UV needs for different plants.
