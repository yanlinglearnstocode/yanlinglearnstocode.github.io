The team focused on exploring problem space, discovering user needs and creating useful solutions and delightful experience. Up until December 2017, I led efforts in conducting user interviews, defining high-level requirements, making 3-D paper prototypes, creating mobile application wireframes, and refining hi-fi prototypes.</p>

The monitor alerts users before the measured UV exposure appraches a damaging limit. The wearable can be used in different forms including a clip, a bracelet or a necklace based on different activity needs. The wearable can be used on its own or be companied with a mobile application that allows users to receive notifications through different forms.</p>

                                        <p>By conducting extensive literature review, we found out that many people have inadequate information about how to effectively protect themselves from UV radiation, and struggle to incorporate sun protection into their daily routine. Technology can help improve people's sun protection habits. April Armstrong's (2009) experiment showed that text-message reminders can promote more frequent sunscreen use. The literature review findings supported our idea of creating a certain kind of reminder for users.</p>

After comparison, we concluded that the necessary functionalities to incorporate sun protection into daily life are distributed in different products. We found out that though smart sun protection product has been a trend in sun care market, current products still have relatively narrow scope and have common problems in usability and user experiences. </p>

When looking into both context scenarios, we found out that while both personas have common problems and needs for a smart UV detecting and reminding product, there are some big implications in terms of designing the overall product and expereince depending on whether it's targeting a single user or a caretaker and children.

                                        <p>After mapping out user goals and needs, we concluded that the most important features should be accurate UV radiation detection, accurate timer, easy-to-interact and non-disturbing reminders, easy-to-understand data and summary and lightweight portable tracker. Therefore, we decided to design a combination of a portable smart gadget and a mobile application as it is the best way to synthesize these features together. I summarized our design framework in the following table.</p>

Rings are also hard to be securely fastened to one's bag or clothing. We were also aware of the fact that many people already have wristbands like fitbits or smart watches, therefore, we decided to make the wearable to be easily used in different forms, it can be wore as a wristband and the main information component can be detached and be used as a clip that can be easily and securely attached to clothing or bags when going out. We came up with an initial design of the wearable component and made a rough physical prototype. </p>

We sketched the push notifications to users when they choose to receive notifications through cell phone. We also sketched the interface of the wearable monitor.
